# Cat World
 University website
 My Cat world website, is a website for the sole purpose of promoting, explaining and platforming a way to communicate to users of our applicaation. Our application is cat tinder and features 4 html sites: the index, the features page, the contact page and the about section. The index page: ie, home page, features a 3d enviornment containing a gallery of images of fake users of the product.I wanted my website to instantly be striking and therefore i picked to make the index page the most complicated of the CSS stylings. The About us section features a little story and reviews left by others users and how they feel about the product. The features are a form site that users can inout their information and submit to us be it for leave their opinions or contact for an issue.The setup instructions are simple just run and it all will be working. easy to navigate with a responsive taskbar that takes you across the different HTML's.
